Task: Write a pseudo code for a battery swapping station.
    I have assumed the existence of various functions and methods for specific tasks such as decoding QR codes, 
    reading RFID cards, accepting MQTT gateways, validating batteries, requesting payment, 
    issuing charged batteries, and displaying messages.
